# NLP-RECOMMENDER-SYSTEM-PROJECT
Sentiment Analysis Model vs Machine Learning Model

Throughout this two-phase project assignment, each team needs to construct “a sentiment analysis model for products based on customers’ textual reviews,” using both a Lexicon approach and a machine learning approach. 
First phase involves uploading the data, cleaning it up, pre-processing the data in order to create a textual representation, and finally, building and testing the Lexicon classifier.  In the second phase, the team needs to construct the same procedure using a Machine learning approach and compare the results of each approach. Lastly, a study of how to utilize the same review data to construct a recommender system is required.
